                Pre-conferences can either be a 1-day (six hour) or a 1/2-day (three hour) session and will occur on Tuesday, February 19, {{site.data.conf.year}}.

                The pre-conference sessions give folks a space to share and build
                knowledge, as well as to teach attendees new skills relevant to library
                technology. Pre-conference sessions can range from workshops to working
                sessions. We welcome a variety of ideas and encourage submissions from
                first-time presenters and members of groups not well-represented within the
                Code4Lib community, including but not limited to: women, people of color,
                people with disabilities, LGBT+.

                If you're looking for inspiration, there are many great examples of pre-conferences from previous years.

                We are taking proposals until October 11, 2018, 5pm PST/8pm EST. After a period
                of public voting on workshops, we hope to confirm sessions with
                facilitators shortly after.
