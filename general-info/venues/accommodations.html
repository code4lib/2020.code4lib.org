        <p>The Code4Lib community aims to make the conference accessible for attendees of all abilities. The {{site.data.conf.venue.name}} has a lengthy list of accessible services on <a href="{{site.data.conf.venue.a11y}}">its Overview page</a> including accessible rooms, restaurants, parking, and routes throughout the hotel campus. Unfortunately, you have to scroll down to the <b>Accessibility</b> section and expand it to see what is offered, we cannot link to it directly.</p>

        <h3>Accommodation Requests</h3>
        <p>
            When registering, attendees were asked to include any accessibility needs
            they might require. We are doing our best to meet these needs. Everyone is
            encouraged to contact the accessibility committee if they have
            questions or new accommodation needs arise. The accessibility committee may
            be contacted by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talking with a volunteer at the registration desk who will forward the request</li>
            <li>Asking for help from a <a href="/conduct/#officers">community support volunteer</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Live Captioning</h3>
        <p>
            During the general conference, Code4Lib {{site.data.conf.year}} will feature live captioning.
            {% if site.data.conf.closed-captioning.show %}
                Attendees, both local and remote, may view the text stream at:
                <a href="{{ site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url }}">{{ site.data.conf.closed-captioning.url }}</a>.
            {% endif %}
