                We encourage all members of the library, archives, museums, cultural
                heritage organizations, and technology community to submit a proposal for a
                prepared talk. Prepared talks should focus on one or more of the following
                areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Projects you've worked on which incorporate innovative implementation of existing technologies and/or development of new software</li>
                <li>Tools and technologies – How to get the most out of existing tools, standards, and protocols (and ideas on how to make them better)</li>
                <li>Technical issues – Big issues in library technology that are worthy of community attention or development</li>
                <li>Relevant non-technical issues – Concerns of interest to the Code4Lib community which are not strictly technical in nature, e.g. collaboration, diversity, organizational challenges, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>
                Proposals can be submitted through Sunday, October 15, 2017 at midnight
                PST (GMT−8).

            <h3>Selection Process</h3>
            <p>
                In order to provide increased opportunities for a diversity of speakers and
                topics, all presentations will be listed by title and description only
                during the voting period. Speaker names will not be included until the
                program is posted. We will also be soliciting 10, 15, and 20 minute talks.
                You'll be asked to indicate which talk lengths you would be willing to
                accommodate for your proposal. In addition, we are holding a poster session
                at the conference. If you would be interested in presenting your topic as a
                poster, please indicate so on the submission form.
            </p>
            <p>
                As in past years, the Code4Lib community will vote on proposals that they
                would like to see included in the program. The top 10 proposals are
                guaranteed a slot of their preferred length at the conference. The Program
                Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure
                diversity in program content and presenters. Community votes will, of
                course, still weigh heavily in these decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Presenters whose proposals are selected for inclusion in the program will
                have conference registration slots held for them (up to 2 speakers per
                talk). In addition, panel participants will have registration slots held.
                The standard conference registration fee will apply.
